    <h1>The Story of elegant problem solving</h1>
    <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem  &  Solved a problem in an elegant way???</h2>
    <h3>In both cases:</h3>
        
    <p>I can't think of only one challenge, but what I do when i stand infront of a challange depends of the challenge itself. For example, if I cannot see 
the solution easily (speaking about code, but also in real life) I will write and make sure that I can see the problem and the goal clearly in front of me. </p> 
<p>I will 
use Pseudocode or just a paper and pen to draw myself to the solution. This guides me towards the right direction, as I can see the steps I need to take on
paper/pseudocode, before I'll start working on the real deal. </p>

<p>Another problem solving skill I'm very comfortable with is "trying something". So, after I have a clear understanding of the challenge, I will create a
rough plan with a rough structure. </p> 

<p>I'll try different paths to find a solution. On the way I'll always ask my great friend "Duck Duck" Go : ) and look for answers on https://www.w3schools.com/ 
thefreecodecamp, developer.mozilla... </p>

<p>When this doesn't help, I'll start talking to myself : ) or to my dog. This is not a sign of insanity, but smart problem solving. I'll talk to try to find
understanding in the actual question I have. Furthermore, I reflect on the way in hope to find a solution in my own words.</p>

<p>I also enjoy "Reading error messages" which provide me with a great step by step guidance. It is so nice to work that way, as I can 
celebrate the success on a step by step basis.</p> <p>"Console.log" is also a great support.</p>

<p>And when all these options don't help, I'll ask my amazing peers for help - and I have to say, that they are always extremely helpful. </p>
<p>Sometimes, I'll also ask my mentor for help. But that's the last resource, as I know that she's super busy : )</p>

<p>Yes, I do like to reflect a lot (especially on paper) - That's how I make sense of the world & Code & myself.</p>
