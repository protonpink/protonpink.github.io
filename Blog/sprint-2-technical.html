    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
    
    <p>    </p>

    <h2>The Margin:>/h2> 
      <p> "Margin" is a CSS property which sets the margin for all four sides. It is an easy way to set all margins without 
        spending to much time on setting up each side separately. There's
    margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left - please have a look on the picture.</p>

    <h2>The Border:</h2>
    <p> The border property is a shorthand property for:</p>

    <p>Border-width</p>
    <p>Border-style (required)</p>
    <p>Border-color</p>
  <p>Please feel free to find the names on the picture.</p>
    
    
  <h2>The Padding:</h2>
  <p> It is used to create space around the element's content, which can also be defined by the border.</p>
<p>I thought that these pictures provide the best kind of understanding. Have a look at the example.  </p>
  
    <p><padding: 25px 50px; </p>
      <p>The top and bottom paddings are 25px</p>
    <p>And the right and left paddings are 50px</p>
