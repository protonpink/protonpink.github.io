    <h1>About myself : )</h1>
    <h3>My core personal values</h3>
      <p>I have enjoyed the personality test on (https://www.16personalities.com/). The outcome has been amazingly accurate.</p> 
        <h2>Personality type: "Assertive Advocate" : )</h2>
        <p>... defined as someone who tends to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. </p>
        <p>I'm an introvert and opperate on intuition and feeling.</p>

      <p>"Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things". </p>


      <h2>My Motto: “Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.” </h2>

    <h3>Ethical decision making based on my culture - values vs. consequences</h3> 

    <p>Growing up as an undetected dyslexic, I've developed a super critical and creative approach to life - a life as an 
      "Assertive Advocate" - always eying out creative solutions to help others. "Many people with this personality type 
      aspire to fix society’s deeper problems, in the hope that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past".

      <h2>"Nothing lights up Advocates like creating a solution that changes people’s lives".</h2>
      <p>... and that's where CODE & DEV Academy come in to PLAY!!!</p>
      

      <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
        Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might 
        intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>

        <p>Always Learning </p>
        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or 
      tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on 
      what other strategies you would try now, and why.</em> </h3>
      <p>My situation: I can be a tat impatient. I've been trying to create change at places where people didn't see it as necessary.</p>
    <p> My learning: Listen to people/my team! Do not pre-conceive anything.</p>
