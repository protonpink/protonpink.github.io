    <h1>My DEV - Learning Plan</h1>
    
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

    <p>- To help our people to live their 100% Human potential. </p>
      
  <p>- To create solutions "via magic code" with and for our people : ).</p>

  <p>While growing up as an undetected dyslexic human being on planet earth, I've developed the desire to advocate for others; to
     make unfairness and hardship become things of the past. </p>
  <p>My motto: “It’s better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging, adventurous, and uncertain, than to say, 
    ’I don’t want to try because I may not succeed completely.'” (Jimmy Carter)</p>
  

    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
    <p>- Strengths: I LOOOOOVE learning; I LOOOOOVE to gain new skills I can use for some more action station.</p>
    <p>- Limitation: Time management - Goal: Feeling re-enegized at the end of the Bootcamp. Need to make regular timeslots 
      for fitness, family, friends and healthy food.</p>

    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
      <p>   - I would like to work on my public speaking : ) </p> 


<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and 
industry/community representatives: </h3>
<p> - I need to make sure that I have good time management; take active breaks (go to gym, walks) and enjoy some time alone. </p> 

<h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>

<p> - have good time management; take active breaks (go to gym, walks), eat healthy food, enjoy some time alone. </p> 

<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
<p> - talk with the team and rest of the team if required. I'm always opting for 
  an open and straight conversation - to get shit done.</p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>A bit of a push for some public speaking opportunities and tech-support for my project</p>

<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
<p>Some weekends are for the family: ) and some evenings will be required for friends & fitness.</p>
