    <h1>The Story of JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h1>
    <h2>Like a loving couple - in the breeze of a warm summer wind. </h2>
    <h3>Let the story begin ... </h3>
        <p></p>

    <p>HTML & CSS are like a loving couple, both partners together create a stable relationship. They share their lives with eachother - in style. 
        They combine their passion for structure and for style. Both of them create the backend component; a static website.</p> 
        
       <p> JS creates the environment of excitement. It enables the fun, the movement, the adventure. It transforms the static webpage into more; into an interactive playground. </p>
        
        <p>With JS in the air, both partners can create the unimagined .</p>
        <h2>   Control flow and loops, arrays and objects</h2>

        <p>With the help of control flow, everything is under control. </p>
        <p>The JS structure guides us to the next river where a new adventure awaits. <p>But if we
        prefer a personalised adventure instead, we have the opportunity to take a loop.</p> 
        <p>The 'do/while' loop, can loop us through a block of code (exciting) for a certain number of times - "as long as the sun shines". </p>
        <p>This can be handy when we plan to dry ourselves off, as we can interupt the js flow, the normal control flow.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Objects and Arrays have a little more complex data structure. They can be visualized as containers for other datatypes in JavaScript, thus the term: data structures.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>An Object {in curly brackets}  is similar to an object for example, a kayak, a gumboot, a truck. It can contain things (other objects), have certain 
        features and can be used for different purposes. </p>
        <p>Arrays [in edgy brackets] don't take value pairs but singular data in them. </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Functions and why they are useful</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        Functions are little task descriptors. They can perform the particular task under normal "control flow", or if certain 
        conditions are set. The great thing with functions is that we can call them repeatedly. The short descriptor saves us from 
        rewriting the code.        </p>

        <p></p>


      <h2>The DOM and DevTools</h2>
<p></p>

<p>
The DOM (Document Object Model) is the playground where HTML and CSS surounded by the breeze of JS can come together to create. The DOM provides
        the main structure as it's sitting above the HTML, but below the window object. From here we can dug a little deeper.         <p></p>
