    <h1>My DEV - Learning Plan</h1>
    
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

    <p>- To help people to live their 100% Human potential. </p>
      
  <p>- To create solutions "via magic code" with and for our people : ).</p>

  <p>Growing up as an undetected dyslexic human being on planet earth, I've developed the desire to advocate for others and to
     do my part to make unfairness and hardship become things of the past. </p>
  <p>My motto: “It’s better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging, adventurous, and uncertain, than to say, 
    ’I don’t want to try because I may not succeed completely.'”</p>
  <p>Jimmy Carter</p>

      regular fitness and healthy food.</p>
