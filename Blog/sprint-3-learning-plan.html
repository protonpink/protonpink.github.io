    <h1>My DEV - Learning Plan</h1>
    
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

    <p>- To help people to live their 100% Human potential. </p>
      
  <p>- To create solutions "via magic code" with and for our people : ).</p>

  <p>Growing up as an undetected dyslexic human being on planet earth, I've developed the desire to advocate for others and to
     create change. My aim is to do my part to ensure that unfairness and hardship become things of the past. </p>
  <p>My motto: “It’s better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging, adventurous, and uncertain, than to say, 
    ’I don’t want to try because I may not succeed completely.'”</p>
  <p>Jimmy Carter</p>

    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
    <p>I LOVE learning; sharpening my new tools for action.</p>
    <p>What I need to take care off: Not being burned out to the end of the Bootcamp. I need to make sure to have regular off-time, 
      regular fittness and healthy food.</p>

    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
      <p>    I would like to become super trooper confident at expessing myself/public speaking. </p> 


<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and 
industry/community representatives
<p> Make sure to have good time management; take active breaks (go to gym, walks) and enjoy some time alone. </h3>p> 

<h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>

<p> Make sure to have good time management; take active breaks (go to gym, walks), eat healthy food and enjoy some time alone. </h3>p> 

<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
<p> I make sure to talk with the team in the first instance and with the rest of the team if required. I'm always opting for 
  a straight conversation - to get shit done.</p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>A bit of a push for public speaking opportunities and Tech-Support for my projects</p>

<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
<p>Weekends are for the kids : ) and some evenings will be required for some fitness.</p>
