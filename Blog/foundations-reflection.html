    <h1>Reflecting on my Learning Journey via Dev Academy - Foundations
    </h1>
    <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of 
      the core learning?</h2>
      <p>1. Time management </p>

      <p>It's important to take regular breaks to embrace full brain capacity. Time doesn't equal 
      quality of learning, it needs quality time to engage in deep learning experiences. I started to really enjoy a 20min 
      learning cycle, which allowed me to opt for a break if neccessary or continue with my challenges 
      for another 20min.</p>
      
      <p>2. Problem solving via duck</p> <p>It had been surprising to learn about the value of talking to a plastic duck.
      My kids thought that I've lost my marbles, but it has helped me to clarify the task and the path towards the goal in 
      my challenge.</p>
      <p>3. I'm also all about the growth mindset and it's rewarding to actively acknowledge the process. The time pressure
      of learning new skills have been a little bit of an oximoron, but I felt it was definetly achieveable. 
      The right learning environment supports neurodiverse capacities and that's the reason why I'm really looking
      forward to use my brain plasticity in the next upcoming weeks - supported by a brilliant team of 
      lifelong learners.</p>
      
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
      Firstly, it is impportant to know your own values to ensure that you understand your own making, 
      to enable best practice within your team. When you understand what makes you tick, others have a chance to 
      understand you; connect with you -  and share a ride beyond the shallow surface. If we recognise and celebrate
      human diversity (human needs and skills and motivations), ... life is just rich and so sweet and - together, we can
      achieve so much more. </p><p>
      Empathy is required to find understanding for eachother, it enables us to connect and thrive towards a collective vision, and 
      it enables us to truely embrace human capabilities - together.</p>

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>Everyone has been very helpful for example on slack. I've always received advice when needed, people have been supportive, and the overall 
      learning environment has been set up on a much deeper level than I've expected, with individual support, mentorship, teamwork, ... 
      which enables a real amazing life experience and for everyone involved.</p>
      
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>Probably the problem solving section - which programming is all about. Keep the head clear and continue 
      embracing Carol Dweck's growth mindset - even in times of time pressure.</p>
      
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>Programming/creating solutions is all about teamwork and therefore it's necessary to set up a working/learning environment based on trust and empathy, in which people
      feel accepted, can be authentic and work within their strengths and weaknesses. The bootcamp style of learning/working (a high pressure environment)
      requires a team that knows it's people very well - to create the best outcome for everyone involved.</p>
      
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p>It has been an enriching learning experience to have people by myside walking the same talk. We have been able to support eachother 
      and learn from eachothers questions - guided by all the core sprints, which have been setting us up for a shared 
      and safe learning environment online and for the bootcamp to come. People need to feel safe to feel comfortable to embrace their human powers. 
      </p>
