    <h1>About myself : )</h1>
    <h3>My core personal values</h3>
      <p>I have enjoyed the personality test on (https://www.16personalities.com/). The outcome has been amazingly accurate.</p> 
        <h2>Personality type: "Assertive Advocate" : )</h2>
        <p>... defined as someone who tends to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. </p>
        <p>I'm an introvert and opperate on intuition and feeling.</p>

      <p>My inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guides me in all things. </p>


      <h2>My Motto: “Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.” </h2>
        
    <p>JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE</p>


    <h3>Ethical decision making based on my culture - values vs. consequences</h3> 

    <p>While growing up as an undetected dyslexic, I've developed a critical and creative approach to life. </p>
    <p>I'm always on the lookout for 
      some kind of creative solution to help others.</p> 
    <p>This personality test states: "Many people with this personality type 
      aspire to fix society’s deeper problems, in the hope that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past".</p>   <p>... 
      and this is sooo freakingly right.</p>
    <p>And this quote says it all:</p>

      <h2>"Nothing lights up Advocates like creating a solution that changes people’s lives".</h2>
      <p>... soooo right ... and that's the reason for my newest endevour: Learn to CODE @ the DEV Academy. </p>

      <p>IT'S TIME TO PLAY WITH CODE : ) </p>

      <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
        Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might 
        intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>

        <p>Always learning, very persistant and driven by a mission. If I can see the purpose, I'll be just fine : ) </p>
        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or 
      tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on 
      what other strategies you would try now, and why.</em> </h3>
      <p>- People become accustomed to the status quo, to a place where 
        they feel dissatisfied but change seemes just too scary, difficult, foreign or overwhelming. In organizations, the status quo hinders 
        innovation, creation and collaboration. The old and frustrating ways of herding people along like sheep are over and out, today we've 
        recognised the need to actively build a living/learning culture based on OUR PEOPLE; on Trust, Empathy, Vulnerability; based on the 
        Human Connection, Collective Purpose, Collective (Knowledge) Creation; based on the Collective Truth;  </p>
    I've learned to 
          <p>- be an active team member </p>
          <p> - ... and not to preconceive anything. </p>
