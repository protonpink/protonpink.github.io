    <h1>My Learning Plan (h1)</h1>
    
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

    <p>My life has always been grounded in my passion to help people to live their 100% Human potential. It's therefore not far fetched to say 
    that it is my goal to create solutions with and for people, that changes their lives for the GREATEST : ).</p>
  <p>Growing up as an undetected dyslexic, I've developed the desire to advocate for others to make sure that unfairness and hardship 
    become things of the past. </p>
  <p>My motto: “It’s better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging, adventurous, and uncertain, than to say, 
    ’I don’t want to try because I may not succeed completely.'”</p>
  <p>JIMMY CARTER</p>

    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
    <p>I LOVE learning; sharpening my new tools for action.</p>
    <p>What I need to take care off: Not being burned out to the end of the Bootcamp. I need to make sure to have regular off-time, 
      regular fittness and healthy food.</p>

    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
      <p>    I would like to become super trooper confident at expessing myself/public speaking. </p> 


<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and 
industry/community representatives
<p> Make sure to have good time management; take active breaks (go to gym, walks) and enjoy some time alone. </h3>p> 

<h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>

<p> Make sure to have good time management; take active breaks (go to gym, walks), eat healthy food and enjoy some time alone. </h3>p> 

<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
<p> I make sure to talk with the team in the first instance and with the rest of the team if required. I'm always opting for 
  a straight conversation - to get shit done.</p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>A bit of a push for public speaking opportunities and Tech-Support for my projects</p>

<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
<p>Weekends are for the kids : ) and some evenings will be required for some fitness.</p>
